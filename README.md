# W3Program
The Weekly Performance Evaluator is a C++ program that checks how well a soccer player trained during the week. The program asks the player’s name, age, training hours, and average sleep per night.

It uses this information to calculate a readiness score that shows how prepared the player is. Then it decides the player’s level — Beginner, Intermediate, or Pro.

The program also gives advice on how to improve, build a training plan, or rest better. All information is shown on the screen and saved in a file called report.txt.
